## 🧠 Reflections

I’m still learning machine learning, so I followed a few tutorials to understand how classification works. I used scikit-learn for the models and Seaborn for basic plots. It was fun experimenting and seeing how the predictions worked. I kept the code simple and focused on understanding each step.

If I had more time, I’d try to learn how to deploy the model or explore other datasets.
